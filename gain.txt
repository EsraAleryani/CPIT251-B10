MONDAY
Main Dish: Stir Fry Sauce – This easy stir fry sauce recipe is made with just a few simple ingredients that you probably already have in your kitchen! Use the stir fry sauce to make a delicious Ground Turkey Stir Fry for dinner and everyone’s mouths will be watering! You can also use a different protein – I suggest 2 pounds for 1 full stir fry sauce recipe.
To make a ground turkey stir fry follow these instructions – Heat a tbsp of oil in a large skillet or wok, then add 2 lbs of ground turkey to the skillet. Cook the turkey until it’s browned and cooked through. Once the ground turkey is cooked, remove it from the skillet and set it aside. Add your choice of veggies to the skillet and cook until they are crisp-tender. You can use bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, snap peas, mushrooms, or any others you prefer.
Return the cooked ground turkey to the skillet with the vegetables. Pour your stir fry sauce over the turkey and veggies, until evenly coated. Stir everything together and cook for a few more minutes until the sauce is heated through and has thickened slightly.
